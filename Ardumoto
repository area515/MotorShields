 Modified sparkfun example for easy use
 
 Individual functions for motor control 
 
 This was a revision of the example sketch that originated from Pete Dokter's code for Arduino that shows very basically how to control an Ardumoto 
 motor driver shield with a 5V Arduino controller board. http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/DevTools/Arduino/Ardumoto_test_3.pde
